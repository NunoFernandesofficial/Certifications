What is TOR?

	TOR was founded by individual researchers who worked at the US Naval research laboratory.
	The basic explanation for how onion routing works is that instead of traffic going from A > B it goes from A > C > J > K > B, and the traffic is encrypted at each part of the jorney, making sure that it can´t be intercepted or sniffed during transit.
	For TOR to work, it need´s "nodes", that are independently-owned servers wich work togheter to make a network (TOR).
