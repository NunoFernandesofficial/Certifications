Online Tracking

	A common thought that exists in the security community is that OSINT operations are completely invisible and at no time will be individual or organizations you are investigating realize who you are. This is why this kind of investigation is called a "Passive operation".

Fingerprinting

	There are programs that can identify "little traces" that you leave behind with your internet browsing, and they are usually used to follow you through the websites you visit hoping to generate a model that helps identify your interests and give you recomendations.
	These little traces are usually not a problem if you are not very skeptical, but imagine how they can impact your work as an OSINT researcher while trying to stay iddent from your targets, it would be a disaster.
