What is threat hunting?

	This is a fairly new discipline in which security professionals use automated tools and manual methods to hunt the network and endpoints for any signs of advanced threats. There are a number of artefacts that hunters search for:

		Undetected Malware: Malicious software that hasn´t been detected by traditional signature-based anti-virus solutions.
		Webshells: Typically .php scripts that allow an attacker to take control of a web server and access everything as if they are on the server directly.
		Unusual Network Activity: such as traffic originating or going to unusual ports, larger than expected packets, and unusual DNS queries,
		Modified System Objects: Such as registry entries on Windows OS that have been altered or impersonated.


Associated Roles

	Threat Hunter:
		Threat Hunters are employed to defend networks by proactively hunting for advanced threats that are already in the network. “US companies took an average of 206 days to detect a data breach” [1], so employing Threat Hunters has the potential to reduce this time, allowing better remediation and less damage.
	Senior security analyst:
		Senior Analysts will perform incident response and security investigations which will contain tasks similar to Threat Hunters. They will locate, investigate, and remove malicious artifacts from compromised systems, as well as respond to suspicious network activity that is more complex.
		Indicent Responder:
			Incident Responders are responsible for reacting to security incidents such as data breaches or system compromises. They will search systems for any evidence left behind by the malicious actors, such as backdoors, files, new user accounts, and more.
