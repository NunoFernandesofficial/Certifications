	Open source intelligence aka osint, is data that has beed obtained from publicly available sources.
	
	A company that has a public web page that introduces some/all of their employees, an attacker could use this to very easily gather a list of targets for social engineering attacks. Some sites may even include contact email addresses or phone numbers.
	
	Job descriptions that leak information about a company´s internal systems (Example: A SysAdmin role requiring experience with win server 2016 and solaris), an attacker can use this to plan internal attacks, lateral movement and privilege escalation once they have gained a foothold in the network.
	
	Reading a user´s social media profile to build up a profile of them (info such as date of birth, locations, friends, interests, family). This can be used to learn more about an individual, witch is commonly done pre-interview so that employees can get a sense of how the person will act in the workplace

Why is it useful?

For defenders:

	By looking at the information that is available on the internet, defenders can take steps to reduce this, or implement other controls that will mitigate attacks or reduce their effectiveness. If an attacker was able to build a detailed profile on an employee, this could be very dangerous. However, if that employee has had security training, then they will potentially be better at spotting malicious emails and social engineering attacks. By removing information online that may aid an attacker, the defenders are reducing the attack surface, which is the total area that an attacker could exploit to gain access to internal systems.

For law enforcement:

	Governement and police organizations will utilize OSINT to track persons of interest, such as criminals, suspects, and terrorists. Profiling is the activity of collecting information on an individual to build up a picture of their personality and behavior. This can be used to predcit where they will be at certain times, based on interests and previous locations. Osint can be used to uncover the identities of cybercriminals that have poor OPSEC (Operational security - the pratice of hiding yourself online by disassociating your online persona with your real self.)

For Bussinesses:

	Businesses can utilize OSINT to keep an eye on the competition, watch for market activity, learn more about their customer and how to best engage with them, improve business operation via data enrichent, and also monitor for security risks such as leaked credentials, employees sharing confidential information, or hackers planning attacks.

For attackers:

	By working out what systems a company uses, the right exploits and attack methods can be planned out in advance. Employee information can be harvested, allowing potentially effective social-engineering attacks, and spear-phishing email campaigns to be conducted, tailored to their intended targets to make them more believable. A company should be careful about what information its systems and employees are sharing online. The process of collecting this information for malicious purposes is commonly referred to as target info gathering.



Associated roles:

	Tatical Threat Analyst
		This role may use OSINT to conduct intelligence operations, gathering information on adversaries that may target their organization. By performing malicious actor tracking, they can stay up to date with the latest trends and techniques used by there groups, in order to implement defenses. 

	Strategic threat analyst:
		This role may conduct threat exposure assessments, working to identify any informatiion that the organization is "leaking" out on the internet. This can be information regarding internal systems, employees that are posting photos of their iD card on social media.

	Security Analyst:
		This role will use OSINT data for a number of reasons, such as checking the reputation of IOCs such as IP addresses (Virus total, IPVoid), or email addresses and file hashes (virus total, ISB, X-force exchange). Other use cases could include investigating fake social-media accounts that are being used to launch social engineering attacks against employees.

	Vulnerability Analyst:
		Osint is a crucial part of this role. Keeping up to date with the latest publicly-announced vulnerabilities, following vulnerability researchers on social media, and info sharing is a really important part of the work these guys do.

	Pentester / Red teamer:
		Offensive security specialists will use OSINT to gain information about their target company, such as internal systems and employee information. This will be used to tailor attacks, helping to reduce the noise they make, and to make them more likely to succeed, resulting in a faster pentest assessment.
